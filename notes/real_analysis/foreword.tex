This is the note on Real Analysis in the fall of 2024 at National Taiwan 
University with Professor Tien. I tried to include all the proofs and 
details that has or has not been covered in the class, in order to make 
this note as self-contained as possible. Some of the proofs might be taken 
from somewhere and some might be wrong. The following topics are covered in 
the lecture: measure theory, Lebesgue integration, Banach space,  
Hilbert space, approximation theory, Fourier transform, spectral theory, 
and unbounded operators.
