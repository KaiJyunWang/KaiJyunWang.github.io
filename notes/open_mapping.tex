\begin{proposition}\label{prop:Baire}
    If $X$ is a Baire space and $F_n$ is a sequence of closed sets in $X$ such that 
    $\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty F_n = X$, then there exists some $n$ and a nonempty open 
    set $G$ such that $G \subseteq F_n$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Let $G_n = F_n^c$ be open sets in $X$. Then $\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty G_n 
    = \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty F_n^c = \pth{\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty F_n}^c = \varnothing$. 
    By the Baire category theorem, at least one of the $G_n$ is not dense in $X$. 
    Thus there is some $x\in G^c$ and an open neighborhood $U$ of $x$ such that 
    $U\bigcap G_n = \varnothing$. This implies $U\subseteq F_n$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Open Mapping Theorem]
    Let $X$ and $Y$ be Banach spaces and $T:X\to Y$ be a bounded surjective linear 
    map. Then for any open set $U\subseteq X$, $T(U)$ is open in $Y$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    We first claim that for any open ball $B$ centered at $0$ in $X$, $\overline{T(B)}$ 
    contains an open neighborhood of zero in $Y$. By the surjectivity, $Y\subset T(X) 
    = T(\bigcup_n nB) = \bigcup_n T(nB)\subset \bigcup_n \overline{T(nB)}$. By 
    \cref{prop:Baire}, there is some $n$ such that $\overline{T(nB)}$ contains an 
    interior point, say $y$, and some open ball $B_r(y)\subset \overline{T(nB)}$. 
    Then for every $z\in Y$ with $\norm{z}<r$, $z-y\in B_r(-y)\subset \overline{T(-nB)} 
    = \overline{T(nB)}$ and
    \begin{equation*}
        z = y + (z-y) \in y + B_r(-y) \subset \overline{T(nB)} + \overline{T(nB)} 
        \subset \overline{T(2nB)}.
    \end{equation*}
    Deviding $z$ by $2n$ gives that $z/2n\in \overline{T(B)}$ and $B_{r/2n}(0)\subset
    \overline{T(B)}$. 

    Next, to shorten the notation, denote $r/2n$ by $\delta$ and $B_{r/2n}(0)$ 
    by $B_\delta$. Let $y\in B_\delta$ and $c_n>0$ be a sequence. Since $B_\delta
    \subset \overline{T(B)}$, $\overline{B_\delta}\subset \overline{T(B)}$. Thus 
    for every nonzero $z\in Y$ and $\epsilon>0$, we can find some $x\in X$ such that 
    $\norm{x}<\delta^{-1}\norm{z}$ and $z\in B_\epsilon(T(x))$. Then 
\end{proof}
