I took Real Analysis in the fall of 2024 with Professor Tien. This is my 
note on the course. I tried to include all the proofs and details that has 
or has not been covered in the class, in order to make this note as 
self-contained as possible. Some of the proofs might be taken from 
somewhere and some might be wrong. The following topics are covered in 
the lecture: measure theory, Lebesgue integration, Banach space and 
Hilbert space.

Some funny things happened in the class. The professor had taught so 
fast that we had already reached the Banach space before our first 
midterm. Every student was wondering if the professor forgot that this 
is actually a one-year course. Time comes to the eleventh week, the 
professor walked into the class and said, ``Few days ago, someone told 
me that we actually have two semesters for real analysis, and I didn't 
know that before!'' It turns out that our concern was right. The professor 
then said, ``But that is also a good thing, because we can learn more 
advanced topics in the second semester, like the harmonic analysis, 
the Fourier analysis\ldots''
